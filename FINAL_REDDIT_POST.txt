DOJ Epstein Dataset 9 Pagination Analysis - 3 Files Appear Scrubbed, Page Limit Found at 184 Quadrillion

TL;DR: After exhaustively scraping the DOJ's Dataset 9 pagination, we found:

1. 3 specific files are LISTED but INACCESSIBLE - potential evidence of document removal
2. The 86GB torrent is MORE complete than DOJ's website (531k files vs 77k exposed)
3. DOJ pagination has an exact limit: page 184,467,440,737,095,516 (that's 184.5 quadrillion)
4. The pagination is an infinite loop - same ~77k files cycle forever across 184 quadrillion pages

THE BIG FINDING: 3 Files Appear to be Scrubbed

These three EFTA files appear in the DOJ's own pagination listing but CANNOT be downloaded by anyone:

EFTA00326497 - Returns error page
https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00326497.pdf

EFTA00326501 - Returns error page
https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00326501.pdf

EFTA00534391 - Returns error page
https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00534391.pdf

Why this matters:
- The DOJ's pagination database KNOWS these files exist (they appear in listings)
- The actual files return "An error was encountered while processing the file"
- They are NOT in any of the public torrents
- EFTA00326497 and EFTA00326501 are sequential - likely related documents

If anyone archived these specific files before removal, please come forward.

The Torrent is Actually More Complete

We compared the 86GB torrent against the DOJ website:

DOJ Website (scraped 13,000 pages): 77,766 files - Only ~15% of actual dataset
86GB Torrent: 531,256 files - 7x more files than DOJ exposes
DOJ-only (not in torrent): 3 files - All inaccessible (listed above)

The DOJ's web pagination only exposes ~15% of Dataset 9's actual contents.
Anyone scraping only the DOJ website would miss 85% of the files.

Pagination Limit: Exactly 184,467,440,737,095,516

Using binary search, we found the exact page where DOJ returns errors:

Last working page: 184,467,440,737,095,516
First failing page: 184,467,440,737,095,517

This number is exactly 2^64 / 100 (max unsigned 64-bit integer divided by 100). The DOJ appears to use a 64-bit page parameter internally.

We probed:
- Sequential: Pages 0-13,000 (found 77,766 unique files)
- Random: 500 pages across 10k-1B range (0 new files)
- End zone: 100 pages backwards from the limit (0 new files)
- Mitnick patterns: ~150 pages using mathematical patterns, magic numbers, edge cases (0 new files)

Conclusion: The pagination is an infinite loop. The same ~77k files cycle forever. Even at page 900,000,000,000,000,000, it returns the same 4 files as page 0.

Methodology

All scripts are open source: https://github.com/degenai/Dataset9

1. Sequential Scraper (scrape_doj_manifest.py)
   - Scraped pages 0-13,000
   - Tracked unique files via deduplication
   - Detected "true wraps" (identical page content) vs "redundant pages"
   - Found content in unexpected places (pages 2460, 3750, 8900, 9997 had new files)

2. Random Probe (exploration_probe.py)
   - 500 random pages from 13k to 1 billion
   - 0 new files found

3. Pagination Limit Finder (find_exact_end.py)
   - Binary search from 13k to infinity
   - Found exact boundary in 104 requests

4. End Zone Scraper (scrape_from_end.py)
   - 100 pages backwards from the limit
   - All loops/redundant, 0 new files

5. Mitnick Probe (mitnick_probe.py)
   - Tested programmer magic numbers (0xDEADBEEF, 1337, etc.)
   - Powers of 2, Fibonacci, primes
   - DOJ-specific patterns (EFTA numbers as page numbers)
   - 0 new files found

What This Means for the Community

1. Use the torrents as primary source - DOJ website hides 85% of content
2. The 3 inaccessible files need investigation - Who has them? When were they removed?
3. DOJ's pagination system is severely broken - Infinite loop, poor organization
4. No hidden content at extreme page numbers - We checked up to 184 quadrillion

Questions for the Community

1. Does anyone have archived copies of EFTA00326497, EFTA00326501, or EFTA00534391?
2. Has anyone else noticed the CDN cutting off downloads at specific offsets?
3. Are there other datasets with similar pagination issues?
