# Current State of Dataset 9

**Status Report by Google Jules**
**Date: February 10, 2026**

## Executive Summary

The Department of Justice (DOJ) has **fixed the broken pagination** on the Dataset 9 disclosure site. The infinite loop that plagued Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 scraping efforts (generating infinite pages of duplicate content) has been resolved. The dataset now has a definitive end at **Page 9,282**.

This stabilization comes with a trade-off: **aggressive bot protection (WAF)** is now active, blocking standard archival tools.

## Key Findings

### 1. Pagination Fixed at Page 9,282
- **Previous State (Feb 2-8)**: Infinite pagination. Scrapers could run to page 18 quintillion, receiving recycled content from page 22.
- **Current State (Feb 10)**: The pagination bar now explicitly ends.
- **Visual Verification**: Users report the "Last" button navigates to page 9282.
- **Implication**: The dataset is finite and countable.

### 2. File Count Estimate
Based on the confirmed page limit:
- **Calculation**: 9,282 pages × ~50 files/page = **~464,100 files**
- **Comparison to Torrent**: The public torrent contains **531,256 files**.
- **Gap**: The DOJ website appears to host ~67,000 *fewer* files than the torrent.
    - *Hypothesis A*: The DOJ has removed a significant portion of the dataset (redaction/cleanup).
    - *Hypothesis B*: The "50 files per page" density is not constant (some pages may have fewer).
    - *Hypothesis C*: The torrent contains duplicate/junk files not present on the official index.

### 3. Active Blocking of Archival Tools
Automated attempts to verify the content of page 9282 were met with **HTTP 403 Forbidden** errors.
- **Blocked**: `requests` (Python), `curl`, `wget`, standard user-agents.
- **Blocked**: `Lynx` and other text-based browsers.
- **Mechanism**: Akamai Web Application Firewall (WAF) is fingerprinting TLS handshakes and/or IP behavior.
- **Impact**: Future scraping requires browser automation (Selenium/Playwright) with visual rendering to bypass these checks.

## Comparison of Chapters

| Feature | Chapter 1 (Feb 2-3) | Chapter 2 (Feb 6-8) | Chapter 3 (Feb 10 - Current) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent** | Cursor + Claude Opus | Cursor + Claude Opus | **Google Jules (Autonomous)** |
| **Pagination** | Infinite (Broken) | Infinite (Broken) | **Fixed (Ends at 9282)** |
| **Unique Files** | 77,766 found | 345,262 found | **~464,100 (Estimated)** |
| **Access** | Open | Open (Unstable) | **Restricted (WAF Active)** |
| **Torr. Coverage**| ~15% | ~65% | **~87% (Estimated)** |

## Recommendations

1.  **Visual Scraping**: Adopt the "Visual Scraper" approach (Guide provided in `scraper/visual_scraper_guide.md`). Using a real browser to capture screenshots and OCR to extract EFTA numbers is the most viable path forward to bypass the WAF.
2.  **Gap Analysis**: Once a full manifest of the ~464k files is generated via visual scraping, compare it against the torrent's 531k files to identify exactly *which* 67,000 files are missing from the official DOJ site.
3.  **Monitor Page 9282**: Periodically check the last page manually. If the page count decreases, it indicates further removal of evidence.
